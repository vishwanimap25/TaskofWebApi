## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone** the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishwanimap25/TaskofWebApi.git
   cd TaskofWebApi


Open a project folder in your IDE.

Restore dependencies (via NuGet or dotnet restore).

Update any database connection strings in appsettings.json.

Run the project (F5 or dotnet run), and use Swagger/Postman to interact with APIs.

📚 Highlights
Implements RESTful conventions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

Demonstrates CRUD operations across multiple domains (inventory, billing, appointments)

Includes modeling, validation, and error handling

Some projects likely use Entity Framework for persistence

Organized into separate tasks/projects—ideal for learning and comparison

🧠 How to Use
Review each task/project folder:

Understand the purpose (e.g., billing vs. appointment management).

Explore Models, Controllers, Services.

Inspect database setup (EF migrations or SQL scripts).

Run and test via Swagger UI or Postman.
